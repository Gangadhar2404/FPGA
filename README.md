# 🧠 FPGA Implementations Repository

This repository contains FPGA-based digital design projects implemented in **Verilog/VHDL**.  
Each project includes:

- ✅ Synthesizable design code  
- 🧩 Testbenches for simulation  
- ⚙️ XDC constraint files for pin mapping and timing  
- 🖥️ Ready-to-run setups for FPGA boards  

These projects are implemented and verified on FPGA hardware, focusing on digital design concepts and practical applications.

---
**Purpose:**  
To share FPGA-implemented designs and XDC constraint files for learning, experimentation, and research.
